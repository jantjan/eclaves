Electronic Claves is a rhythm game that can be played solo or with another person. 

Guided by a bi-directional rhythm display, players can sync up their controllers to a rhythm and make use of surfaces in their space to bring the beat to life.   The game can be a tool to improve oneâ€™s sense of rhythm or a meditative way to pass time. To improve the coordination between their two hands or between two players, users may practice any two-measure drumming pattern and adjust the game speed.

## Project 1: 1D Interface Prompt

We will start the course by creating a 1D game and a custom joystick for controlling it. Students will learn techniques for in-hardware sketching and prototyping, creating state diagrams, building their own electronics, designing a graphical user interface, coding, as well as techniques for evaluating and critiquing interaction and interface design.

## Project 2: IRL Prompt

The global pandemic has forever changed how we work, learn and play, making virtual communication the primary form of human interaction. In Project 2, we will design physical interfaces that allow for remote communication and collaboration, allowing students to extend their virtual reach into each other's physical spaces. We will extend and augment video chatting with networked objects and explore notions of remote presence, simultaneous actions, shared experience and telepresence. We will collaborate with ECAL in Lausanne, Switzerland to develop and test our interfaces.
