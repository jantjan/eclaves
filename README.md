Electronic Claves is a rhythm game that can be played solo or with another person. Guided by a bi-directional rhythm display, players can sync up their controllers to a rhythm and make use of surfaces in their space to bring the beat to life.   The game can be a tool to improve oneâ€™s sense of rhythm or a meditative way to pass time. To improve the coordination between their two hands or between two players, users may practice any two-measure drumming pattern and adjust the game speed.
